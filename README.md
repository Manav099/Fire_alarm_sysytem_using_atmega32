# Fire_alarm_sysytem_using_atmega32
This project is a simple and effective fire alarm system based on the ATmega32 microcontroller. It uses a smoke or gas sensor (like MQ-2) to detect the presence of smoke or flammable gases. The sensor output is read by the microcontroller through its ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter). When the smoke level crosses a predefined threshold, the system triggers an alarm by activating a buzzer and LED indicator.

This system is useful for early fire detection in homes, offices, or industrial environments, providing both visual and audio alerts to prevent hazards.
